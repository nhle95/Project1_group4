Historical Alternative Fueling Station Counts
"This spreadsheet shows historical alternative fueling station counts by state on an annual basis since December 2007. This data is based on the number of public and private (non-residential) stations in the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) Alternative Fueling Station Locator (https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/) near the end of December each year. You can see total fuel type counts in the ""Total"" row at the bottom of each tab. 

Note that changes in total counts represent both stations that opened and went out of service. For example, if the number of stations increased from 200 to 210 in one year, it could have been that 15 stations opened and 5 stations went out of service. 

Please note the following regarding counts for the electric vehicle (EV) charging station data: 
 - Starting in 2011, EV charging was counted by the outlet rather than by the geographical location. 
 - Beginning in 2014, the historical data for EV charging includes both the number of EV charging station locations and the number of outlets at each location.  
 - Starting in 2020, EV charging data is provided by charger level.

Please note the following regarding counts for propane station data:
 - Starting in 2020, propane station data is broken down by primary or secondary designations. 

Please note the following regarding counts for hydrogen station data:
 - Starting in 2020, hydrogen station data is provided by retail or non-retail designations.

EV Station Count Update
"In 2021, there was a jump in EV charging station counts. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is transitioning EV charging counting logic to align with the hierarchy defined in the Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI; https://evroaming.org/ocpi-background/) protocol: stations, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) ports, and connectors (https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC&show_ev_terms=true). With this transition, the number of charging outlets in the Station Locator is being updated to represent the number of EVSE ports (number of vehicles that can charge simultaneously) at a station location rather than the number of connectors previously counted. The Station Locator still identifies the available connector types.

NREL imports EV charging station data from many charging networks, including Blink, ChargePoint, Electrify America, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots, SemaConnect, OpConnect and Webasto, via each network’s application programming interface (API). Most networks have adopted the OCPI protocol to support roaming agreements with other networks, and to date, NREL has integrated Electrify America, EVgo, Greenlots, and ChargePoint’s OCPI-based APIs. Additionally, all non-networked charging data in the Station Locator follow the OCPI protocol.

Greenlots and ChargePoint’s OCPI APIs were integrated in 2021. This resulted in jumps in station counts because of the way that station data were shared under the protocol: in many cases, one station was split into several new stations to represent different physical locations of EVSE ports at one address. While the new stations shared the same street address, they had different coordinates. Additionally, jumps in station counts were attributed to new installations being added via the APIs. 

For more information on stations imported via an API and the OCPI protocol, please review the following report: https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/evolution-pev-charging-infrastructure.pdf. "

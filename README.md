Project Description/Outline: Are electric cars as green as we think they are? We will dive into what emissions the electric car releases. We will be analyzing the impact of electric vehicles and their surge in our society.

Research Questions to Answer: 

Q1: Is EV popular?

As expected, the graphs show us that EVs are on the rise over time. From 2016 to 2021, there has been an great increase in EVs and Plug-in Hyrbrid vehicles registration is the US, from approximately 20,000 vehicles per year in 2016 to almost 112,000 vehicles in 2021. When we compared it with Gasoline car, EVs registrations increased by 15%-50% every year while gasoline vehicle registration only increased by less than 10% yearly. During the same period, automakers flooded the market with new models. There were about 150 models in the US in 2016, but automakers have since released another 100 models in a 5 year span, so customers have more options to choose from. 


Q2: What emissions do electric cars emit? 


Q3: Has the introduction of electric cars brought on a decrease in emissions overall?

With the introduction of electric vehicles, the emissions are beginning to show changes. Viewing the the figures above, the emissions from the transportation sector nationally and at the state level have decreased. However, this does not occur until year 2019. The reason may be the number of EVs up until that point were not enough to stop emissions from increasing. Eventually, emissions have decreased with the introduction of electric cars.

Q4: What impact does a switch to alternative fuel vehicles have on overall emission?

Project Description/Outline: Are electric cars as green as we think they are? We will dive into what emissions the electric car releases. We will be analyzing the impact of electric vehicles and their surge in our society.

Research Questions to Answer: 

Q1: Is EV popular?

As expected, the graphs show us that EVs are on the rise over time. From 2016 to 2021, there has been an great increase in EVs and Plug-in Hyrbrid vehicles registration is the US, from approximately 20,000 vehicles per year in 2016 to almost 112,000 vehicles in 2021. When we compared it with Gasoline car, EVs registrations increased by 15%-50% every year while gasoline vehicle registration only increased by less than 10% yearly. During the same period, automakers flooded the market with new models. There were about 150 models in the US in 2016, but automakers have since released another 100 models in a 5 year span, so customers have more options to choose from. 





Q2: Has the introduction of electric cars brought on a decrease in emissions overall?

With the introduction of electric vehicles, the emissions are beginning to show changes. Viewing the the figures above, the emissions from the transportation sector nationally and at the state level have decreased. However, this does not occur until year 2019. The reason may be the number of EVs up until that point were not enough to stop emissions from increasing. Eventually, emissions have decreased with the introduction of electric cars.

Q3:  What impact does a switch to alternative fuel vehicles have on overall emissions from vehicles nationally?

When looking at vehicle emissions two categories that are  observed are air pollutants such as smog, haze and greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane. Looking at data from the Vehicle Technology Office in the US Department  of Energy  they have focused on the greenhouse gasses and have collected the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted by an electrical vehicle(EV) by state in 2016. As you can see, the highest amount of carbon dioxide emitted was 11,435 lbs.  This is the average amount of carbon dioxide that is emitted  from a car  that uses only gasoline as a fuel source. Compared  to the  national average of 4,815 lbs of carbon dioxide emitted by EVs.  A switch to electrical cars would decrease the amount of carbon dioxide that is emitted overall, but it would not affect every state in the same way.

Looking at carbon dioxide by state, some states like West Virginia, Kentucky, and Wyoming stand out for having electric cars emissions that are near the average  for cars that use gasoline.   This is due to these states using coal as the main source of energy to produce  electricity. Then there are states such as Vermont, Washington, and Idaho that use hydropower (the use of the natural flow of water to produce electricity) to produce electricity. The states have the lowest production of carbon dioxide  While states like Texas,New Jersey,Oklahoma  that use natural gas,nuclear power,or wind power  sources to produce electricity, are close to the national average for emissions or below it.  Getting all states to switch to electrical vehicles could help but a real change in greenhouse emission will not take place until states focus on using renewable courses of energy to produce electricity.
